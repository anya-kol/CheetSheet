                    <p>The UK has at least fifty species of native trees and shrubs, and many more species of introduced non-native trees.</p>
                        
                    <p>There are lots of features that give you clues to what species it is.</p>
                        <div class="bottom-nav">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Look at the leaves or needles. Is it a broadleaf (usually deciduous) or is it a conifer (usually with needles or scales)?</li>
                                <li>Different features will be visible through the seasons. In winter, for broadleaf trees, you'll have to use twigs, leaf buds and bark.</li>
                                <li>Take notice of the surrounding area such as hedgerows, fields, parks, woodland or close to water. Some species are more likely to grow near water, in scrubland, parkland or in woodland.</li>
                                <li> Piece the clues together, including the overall shape and size of the tree, bark, leaves or needles, flowers, fruits, leaf buds and twigs. The more features you can see, the more accurate your identification will be.</li>
